# Air-Pollution-Analysis
From the above analysis, we see that the majorly affected states in India by air pollution belong to the northern region.
States like Delhi, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana are heavily polluted and require immediate action.
We also saw that even if a state had a high level of pollutants, there were some regions in the states that were not polluted.
We also see from statistical analysis â€” scatter plots that the states with high rspm concentrations also have high spm concentrations.
From the heatmap, we conclude that some states were heavily polluted in the early stages(1980 to 2000) but, later, were taken care of.
The reason for the decrease could be awareness in citizens and government policies.
For example, The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 was an Act to provide for the prevention, control and abatement of air pollution.
